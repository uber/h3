The function _faceIjkToGeoBoundary calculates the ijk coordinates of the cell center point in the appropriate substrate grid (determined in the last step), and each of the substrate vertices is translated using the cell center point ijk. Each vertex ijk is then transformed onto the appropriate face and Hex2d coordinate system using the approach taken in finding a cell center point.

H3 supports replacing the memory management functions (malloc, calloc, realloc, free) used by the library at build time. This can be used to integrate H3 within a managed framework. When using custom memory allocators, H3 prefixes the names of memory allocation functions with the string you specify. The application linking H3 must have the prefixed replacement functions defined, or you must change the H3 build to link against the prefixed replacement functions. When building H3, specify the H3_ALLOC_PREFIX option to your prefix of choice, as below: cmake -DH3_ALLOC_PREFIX=my_prefix_ .  Then, in your application using H3, implement the following functions, replacing my_prefix_ with the prefix you chose above: void* my_prefix_malloc(size_t size); void* my_prefix_calloc(size_t num, size_t size); void* my_prefix_realloc(void* ptr, size_t size); void my_prefix_free(void* ptr);  info H3 does not currently use realloc.

The function _h3ToFaceIjk then converts the H3 index to the appropriate icosahedron face number and normalized ijk coordinate's on that face's coordinate system as follows: We start by assuming that the cell center point falls on the same icosahedron face as its base cell.It is possible that the cell center point lies on an adjacent face (termed an overage in the code), in which case we would need to use a projection centered on that adjacent face instead. We recall that normalized ijk coordinates have at most two non-zero components, and that in a face-centered Class II system the sum of those components is a resolution-specific constant value for cells that lie on the edge of that icosahedral face. We determine whether an overage exists by taking the sum of the ijk components, and if there is an overage the positive ijk components indicate which adjacent face the cell center lies on. A lookup operation is then performed to find the appropriate rotation and translation to transform the ijk coordinates into the adjacent face-centered ijk system. The face-centered ijk coordinates are then converted into corresponding Hex2d coordinates using the function _ijkToHex2d.The function _hex2dToGeo takes the Hex2d coordinates and scales them into face-centered gnomonic coordinates, and then performs an inverse gnomonic projection to get the latitude/longitude coordinates.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"H3 Index","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/core-library/h3Indexing","content":"","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Introduction​","type":1,"pageTitle":"H3 Index","url":"/docs/core-library/h3Indexing#introduction","content":"The H3 system assigns a unique hierarchical index to each cell.

The hexagonal grid system is created on the planar faces of a sphere-circumscribed icosahedron, and the grid cells are then projected to the surface of the sphere using an inverse face-centered polyhedral gnomonic projection. The coordinate reference system (CRS) is spherical coordinates with the WGS84/EPSG:4326 authalic radius. It is common to use WGS84 CRS data with the H3 library. The icosahedron is fixed relative to the sphere using a Dymaxion orientation (due to R. Buckminster Fuller). This orientation of a spherical icosahedron places all 12 icosahedron vertices in the ocean. (At the time of H3's development, this was the only known orientation with this property. Others have since been found.) The H3 grid is constructed on the icosahedron by recursively creating increasingly higher precision hexagon grids until the desired resolution is achieved. Note that it is impossible to tile the sphere/icosahedron completely with hexagons; each resolution of an icosahedral hexagon grid must contain exactly 12 pentagons at every resolution, with one pentagon centered on each of the icosahedron vertices. The first H3 resolution (resolution 0) consists of 122 cells (110 hexagons and 12 icosahedron vertex-centered pentagons), referred to as the base cells. These were chosen to capture as much of the symmetry of the spherical icosahedron as possible. These base cells are assigned numbers from 0 to 121 based on the latitude of their center points; base cell 0 has the northern most center point, while base cell 121 has the southern most center point. Each subsequent resolution beyond resolution 0 is created using an aperture 7 resolution spacing (aperture refers to the number of cells in the next finer resolution grid for each cell); as resolution increases the unit length is scaled by sqrt(7) and each hexagon has 1/7th the area of a hexagon at the next coarser resolution (as measured on the icosahedron). H3 provides 15 finer grid resolutions in addition to the resolution 0 base cells. The finest resolution, resolution 15, has cells with an area of less than 1 m2. A table detailing the average cell area for each H3 resolution is available here. Note: you can create KML files to visualize the H3 grids by running the kml make target. It will place the files in the KML output sub-directory.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Testing strategy","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/core-library/testing","content":"","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Unit testing​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Testing strategy","url":"/docs/core-library/testing#unit-testing","content":"Github Actions are used to run the H3 test suite for every commit.

The macros behave differently, depending on the build configuration: Under release builds of the library (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release), the defensive code is included without modification. These branches are intended to be very simple (usually only returning an error code and possibly freeing some resources) and to be visually inspectable. Under debug builds of the library (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug), the defensive code is included and assert calls are included if the defensive code is invoked.

Under coverage builds of the library (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ENABLE_COVERAGE=ON), the defensive code is not included by replacing its condition with a constant value.

Derivation of the cell count formula​ We can derive the formula above with the following steps. First, let h(n)h(n)h(n) be the number of children n≥0n \\geq 0n≥0 resolution levels below any single hexagaon. Any hexagon has 777 immediate children, so recursion gives us that h(n)=7n.h(n) = 7^n.h(n)=7n. Next, let p(n)p(n)p(n) be the number of children n≥0n \\geq 0n≥0 resolution levels below any single pentagon. Any pentagon has 555 hexagonal immediate children and 111 pentagonal immediate child. Thus, p(0)=1p(0) = 1p(0)=1 and p(1)=6p(1) = 6p(1)=6. For n≥1n \\geq 1n≥1, we get the general recurrence relation p(n)=5⋅h(n−1)+p(n−1)=5⋅7n−1+p(n−1).\\begin{aligned} p(n) &amp;= 5 \\cdot h(n-1) + p(n-1) \\\\ &amp;= 5 \\cdot 7^{n-1} + p(n-1). \\end{aligned}p(n)​=5⋅h(n−1)+p(n−1)=5⋅7n−1+p(n−1).​ For n≥0n \\geq 0n≥0, after working through the recurrence, we get that p(n)=1+5⋅∑k=1n 7k−1=1+5⋅7n−16,\\begin{aligned} p(n) &amp;= 1 + 5 \\cdot \\sum_{k=1}^n\\ 7^{k-1} \\\\ &amp;= 1 + 5 \\cdot \\frac{7^n - 1}{6}, \\end{aligned}p(n)​=1+5⋅k=1∑n​ 7k−1=1+5⋅67n−1​,​ using the closed form for ageometric series. Finally, using the closed forms for h(n)h(n)h(n) and p(n)p(n)p(n), and the fact that (by definition) resolution 0 has121212 pentagons and 110110110 hexagons, we get the closed form for the total number of cellsat resolution rrr as c(r)=12⋅p(r)+110⋅h(r)=2+120⋅7r.\\begin{aligned} c(r) &amp;= 12 \\cdot p(r) + 110 \\cdot h(r) \\\\ &amp;= 2 + 120 \\cdot 7^r. \\end{aligned}c(r)​=12⋅p(r)+110⋅h(r)=2+120⋅7r.​ Jupyter notebook​ A notebook to produce the cell count table above can befound here.
