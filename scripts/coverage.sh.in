# To invoke this script, use `bash coverage.sh <source-dir> <binary-dir>`,
# where `source-dir` corresponds to CMake source directory and `binary-dir`
# corresponds to the CMake build directory. This script is used to run the
# `coverage` target. In order to guarantee that `coverage` is only a valid
# target in debug builds, we must know the build mode. However, CMake tries to
# delay the selection of the build mode until the build itself. This allows
# tools like Xcode to choose to build in debug mode or release mode without
# rerunning CMake. In order to control the `coverage` target based on the build
# mode, this script is regenerated whenever a new build mode is selected,
# regardless of whether or not the `cmake` command is invoked again.
#
# Example:
#
# ```
# $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
# $ xcodebuild -configuration Release  # coverage.sh generated
# $ xcodebuild -configuration Release  # coverage.sh not regenerated
# $ xcodebuild -configuration Debug    # coverage.sh regenerated
# ```

set -e

if [[ $<BOOL:$<CONFIG:Debug>> != 1 ]]; then
    echo "Cannot run coverage for non-debug build" 1>&2
    exit 1
